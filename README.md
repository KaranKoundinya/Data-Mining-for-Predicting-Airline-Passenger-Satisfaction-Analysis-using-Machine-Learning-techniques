This project focuses on data mining techniques to analyze the "AIRLINE PASSENGER SATISFACTION" dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset explores various aspects of the airline experience, such as airline type, customer type, inflight services, and onboard amenities, with the goal of predicting passenger satisfaction based on these features.

The team selected this dataset due to its relevance to the common issue of customer satisfaction in the airline industry. Through data mining, researchers can uncover meaningful patterns and behavioral insights associated with this topic, enabling a deeper understanding of the factors influencing passenger satisfaction.

The analysis was conducted using two major tools: Google Colab for Python scripting and RapidMiner. The team employed logistic regression, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbors algorithms to classify passenger experiences as satisfactory, dissatisfactory, or neutral. Both RapidMiner and Google Colab were utilized to implement and compare the performance of these algorithms.

Logistic regression was chosen as the base algorithm due to its suitability for binary classification problems and its ability to predict the probability of an event occurring, such as determining whether a passenger's experience was satisfactory or dissatisfactory/neutral.

Following the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, the project ensures a systematic and repeatable approach to data analysis. By applying data mining techniques, businesses can uncover valuable insights, patterns, and trends, enabling informed decisions regarding pricing strategies, package positioning, and customer targeting.
